## CI/CD Pipeline

### CI/CD Pipeline Environment

- The CI/CD Pipeline operates within the Github ecosystem, leverging GitHub Actions. Github Actions provides a flexible integrated environment for automating the software development lifecycle. The infrastructure primarily consists of GitHub's cloud-based services, enabling seamless integration with our version control system. Our target operating system for the pipeline is Linux, ensuring compatibility across various deployment environments. Additionally, network configurations are optimized to facilitate secure and efficient communication between the CI/CD pipeline components and external systems. 

### CI/CD Pipeline Tools

- **GitHub Actions**: GitHub Actions was chosen as the primary tool for our CI/CD pipeline due to its tight integration with GitHub repositories, ease of setup, and extensive library of actions. Its features include support for various programming languages, containerization, and customizable workflows. GitHub Actions excels in automating workflows triggered by events such as pushes, pull requests, or scheduled tasks. While GitHub Actions offers robust capabilities, it may have limitations in complex build scenarios or large-scale enterprise deployments.

 ### Automation Process

 1. **Code Compilatioon** -  Upon a push or pull request event, the CI/CD pipeline triggers a workflow to compile the codebase. This step involves fetching the latest code changes and running the appropriate build commands specified in the project configuration.
 2. **Unit Testing** - Following successful compilation, the pipeline executes unit tests to ensure code integrity and identify any regressions. Unit tests are essential for validating the functionality of individual components in isolation.
3. **Integration Testing** - Upon passing unit tests, the pipeline proceeds to integration testing, where the application is deployed to a staging environment resembling the production setup. Integration tests simulate real-world interactions between different modules or services to validate end-to-end functionality and compatibility.
4. **Deployment** -  If all tests pass, the pipeline automatically deploys the application to the production environment. Deployment involves packaging the application artifacts, provisioning resources, and orchestrating the deployment process using infrastructure-as-code tools such as Terraform or Kubernetes manifests.
